For the dinosaur lovers; QR Codes of action figures of Jurassic World

## What?
* Some Action Figures of Jurassic World had stickers that act as a QR Code.
* The sticker can be scanned by their app leading to facts and 3d content of the figure.

## How?
* Digitalizing the sticker with the footprint that act as a QR Code and making a SVG image that we can controll with some javacript/css.
* Reading the sticker and making a numeric array that states the location and colors of the segments in the QR Code.

## Why?
* My son an I loved the toys and want to share this facinating world; we highly recommend buying the figures.
* Some stickers fall appart after a while (who doesnt play with water and mud and dinosaurs?), so this act as a backup.

## Next?
* Format for the GUI
* Keep adding stickers
* Invite dino lovers to feel free to add the missing parts.
